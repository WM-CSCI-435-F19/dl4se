# Data Mining Tasks for the SLR of DL4SE

> *Last update:* April 9th 2020; *Maintaned by* @danaderp

Before carrying out any mining tasks, we decided to address a basic descriptive statistics procedure for each feature. These statistics exhibit basic relative frequencies, counts, and quality metrics. We revised 4 quality metrics: ID-ness, Stability, Missing, and Text-ness. ID-ness measures to what extent a feature resembles an ID -the “title” is the only feature with a high ID-ness value. Stability measures to what extent a feature is constant (or have the same value). Missing is the number of missing values. Finally, Text-ness measures to what extent a feature contains free-text. The results for each feature can be navigated once the SRL process is run in RapidMiner. As for the data mining tasks employed, we focused on three of them: Correlations, Association Rule Learning, and Clustering.

## Correlations by Mutual Information

### Association Rule Learning

### Clustering
