> *Last update:* Feb 16th 2020; *Maintaned by* @danaderp

To draw conclusions for the SLR, we had to employ different techniques to obatain a representative sample of DL4SE papers. We want to reduce the risk of "sampling bias" bu introducing a combined strategy of Non-probability and Probability Sampling.   

## Non-Probability Sampling
Here we can find "Purposive Sampling" and "Snowball Sampling".  (complete explanation here)


## Probability Sampling
We employed "Stratified Sampling" to came up with a proportion of samples by conference.
